            In the winter of 2011, while serving as working members at ADX,
            Portland’s Makerspace, Zach and Josh met and became friends, sharing
            a love of art, punk, and burritos. With the help of their friends at
            ADX, they formed Band, a diverse, draw-it-by-hand,
            make-it-from-scratch, do-it-together creative studio, in a room they
            built above the shop’s kitchen.
          </h3>
          <h3>
            In the years since, Band has worked on a wide array of unique
            projects with some of the best people from the Pacific Northwest and
            beyond. We strive to keep our work unique and smart, with room for a
            little magic. You can find us anywhere, and if the project is the
            right fit, we’d love to work with you. Feel free to drop us a line,
            here.
